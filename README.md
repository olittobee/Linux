# Linux

Project Linux is an open source project that has revolutionized the way we use computers. It is a complete operating system, which means it includes everything you need to run and manage your computer - from the hardware drivers to applications and tools. With Project Linux, you can customize your computing experience in ways that were never before possible with traditional proprietary software solutions.
